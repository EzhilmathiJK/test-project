            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: lightgray;">"Chicken Biryani" is a classic Indian dish known for its aromatic flavors and rich taste. It is made with long-grain basmati rice, marinated chicken pieces, and a blend of spices. The dish is typically cooked in layers, with the marinated chicken cooked separately and then layered with partially cooked rice. Each layer is infused with spices, including cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, along with fresh herbs like cilantro and mint. The layers are then steamed together, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the fragrant spices. Chicken Biryani is often served with raita (a yogurt-based side dish) and is a favorite at festive occasions and celebrations.</p>
